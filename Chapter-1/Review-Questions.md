## SECTION 1.1

### R1. What is the difference between a host and an end system? List several different types of end systems. Is a Web server an end system?

No defference.  
In page 41:

> Throughout this book we will use the terms hosts and end systems interchangeably; that is, host = end system.

End systems:

- PC
- Phone, Laptop
- Wearable Device
- Workstation, Server
- Game console

Yes.

### R2. Describe the protocol that might be used by two people having a telephonic conversation to initiate and end the conversation, i.e., the way that they talk

1. The Caller enter the phone number of the person he wants to talk and calls.
2. Waiting for the call to go through. If not, check the phone number and wait a few minutes to try again.
3. The Callee says "hello" -- inform the Caller that he is listening.
4. The Caller ask the Callee if he is the person he wants to talk to.
5. If the answer is "yes" -- the Caller tell his name and start the conversation.
6. Conversation continues until the either of the Caller or Callee says the words to end the conversation.
7. Say "bye" to the other person and end the conversation.

### R3. Why are standards important for protocols?

It the rules that govern the way hosts communicate. If the standards is not specific or vary from host to host, then communication will not be successful. Because machines are not as smart as humans.

## SECTION 1.2

### R4. List four access technologies. Classify each one as home access, enterprise access, or wide-area wireless access

Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, and 5G Fixed Wireless.
Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi.
Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G.

### R5. Is HFC transmission rate dedicated or shared among users? Are collisions possible in a downstream HFC channel? Why or why not?

shared among users. No.

In page 45.

> One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In
> particular, every packet sent by the head end travels downstream on every link to every home and every
> packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end.

### R6. What access network technologies would be most suitable for providing internet access in rural areas?

Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE 4G and 5G.

### R7. Dial-up modems and DSL both use the telephone line (a twisted-pair coppercable) as their transmission medium. Why then is DSL much faster than dial-up access?

In page 43.

> The home’s DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmis-sion over telephone wires to the CO.
> The residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone signals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:
> • A high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band
> • A medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band
> • An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band

### R8. What are some of the physical media that Ethernet can run over?

twisted-pair copper wire

### R9. Dial-up modems, HFC, DSL and FTTH are all used for residential access. For each of these access technologies, provide a range of transmission rates and comment on whether the transmission rate is shared or dedicated

| Types | Downstream     | Upstream       | shared/ dedicated |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| DSL   | 24Mbps~52Mbps  | 3.5Mbps~16Mbps | dedicated         |
| HFC   | 40Mbps~1.2Gbps | 30Mbps~100Mbps | shared            |
| FTTH  | 40Mbps~1.2Gbps | 30Mbps~100Mbps | shared            |

### R10. Describe the most popular wireless Internet access technologies today. Compare and contrast them

3G, WiFI
